1. Discussions with Hugging Face

Synopsis: Hugging Face offers a free public facing service which allows anyone to publish AI models. 
They also provide a paid public service which allow any published model to be run. 
The free service runs off a Hub software which is proprietary software. 

The Hub software has similarities with the open source catalog that ENG is building. 


Options for Collaboration: 
  - Open Source Plug-Ins for Hugging Face model 
  - Configure ENG core work to be compatible with Hugging Face services, i.e. support their APIs (will require their consent)
      - Define meaning of openness and how the interfaces will work to keep the open option.

Second option voted upon and agreed by the attendees. 

Next Steps: David Edelsohn to check with Hugging Face, and subsequent follow up with ENG Board and Hugging Face.

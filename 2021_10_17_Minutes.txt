Minutes of Discussions

1. Hugging Face Discussions 
    - Hugging Face expecting a casual conversation with 1 or 2 people, not a broad conversation 
    - What ENG can offer to Hugging Face is not very clear 
    - Proposal: Request Hugging Face to use Hugging Face APIs for the catalog 
    - Hugging Face may or may not accept it -- depends on how critical keeping ownership of the APIs to them. 
    - 
    
Next Steps: David will go back to Hugging Face for feedback. 

2. SMC 2022 demo to be repeated in collaboration with Secure AI Connectivity Working Group.
